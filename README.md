## Overview and Orgin of  iROBOT 
iRobot
Founded in 1900 
The founders were from the Massachesetss Institute of Technology and thier names are Rodney Brooks, Colin Angle and Helen Greiner
The orginal purpose of the company was to create robots for space exploration.
The company is funded by the revenue of its products such as the Roomba robot that sold over 50 million robots worldwide. 

## Business Activites 
The goal of the company is to build robots that assist in providing people with more effecient ways to clean and accomplish more feats in their daily lives.
The target audience for iRobot is the tech savy homeowners. In the US the company has a popularity of 23 percent and is used by 15 percent of the US smart home demographic.
iRobot in the fourth quater of 2023 had a significant market share of 52.63% and this dominate demonstration can be credited to their ability to produce high-quality robotic cleaners that satisfy the majority of the market.
iRobots Roomba vacuum cleaner is a staple in the market of robotic vacuum cleaners, one that contributes to the strong reputation of the brand.

## Landscape

iRobot is robotics field
The robotics cleaning market is expected to witness a significant growth from 2024 to 2031 due to the rising demand for cleaning Robotics and government policies that favor this growth.
Other companies in the robotics field are LionsBot, Narwal and UBTECH Robotics.

## Results
iRobot achieved a GAAP net income of $0.30 per share.  The use of the Generally Accepted Accounring Principle is to be transparent and accountable for finacial reportings. This outcome was a win for the company even though a decrease of revenue was reported in the first quarter.
iRobots still is at the forefront in the robotics field specifically cleaning robots.

## Recommendations
iRobots most iconic product is the Roomba. I beleive that approach can be used to target other cleaning task and home maintance activites such as snow plowing and lawn mowing.
These new devices can utilize the basic AI capabilites that the Roomba utilizes to identify areas and objects to avoid with use of built in sensors.
The use of AI with built in sensors are vital to the technology to ensure that the product does over step its purpose. An example of this would be the technology established in CoreTemp which utilizes AI with advanced algorithms to predict core temp but in this case maybe it can be used to idetify snow by temparture and if its to mow the lawn a similiar AI can ID thero temparature to ensure only the grass is being cut and avoid a certain temp that may be a human or house pet.
